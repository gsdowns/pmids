Scripts to collect and summarize PMIDs

extractPMIDs.sh was used to extract PMIDs from JSON files (the format of which is specific to Watson for Genomics). Two python scripts were used to:

1) get publication date and journal name via the Pubmed API
2) do some date-math for average age and such
3) count the frequency of citations to each journal
